# WPFCalculator
WPFCalculator is a calculator designed in WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation) based on some of the features of Casio's CG50 Graphical Calculator.

Run-Solve used for calculations shown with on-screen keyboard window. Equivalent syntax / parsing system as other calculator functions. Expand through use of matrix calculations through the Matrix Class and visual matrix input created with a UserControl.
# Graphing

Graphing calculator with adjustable bounds. Useful for intuition / understanding of behaviour of trigonometric, hyperbolic and rational functions.


Next Steps:

  Colour difference for each function line
  
  Asymptotic representation
  
   Add support for input/parsing of implicit functions eg "xy = 5" "x^2 + y^2 = 25"

Distributions

Discrete Distributions

Binomial distribution shown above. Probability mass function and cumulative distribution function both provided.

Continous Distributions

Normal distribution shown above. Probability measure function in development. Cumulative distribution can be calculated and graphed numerically but uses unclear except for developing a students understanding of the cumulative distribution function.


Chi Test

Chi test as taught in A-level AQA Further Mathematics. The user inputs the grid size, then the values to receive the expected table. Calculator can then return chi test statistic.

As shown above, 2x2 tables (that have one degree of freedom) asks for if Yate's correction should be used. Yate's correction important in AQA Further Mathematics but real-world application limited because it can be unreliable/incorrect.

Sample Analysis

Currently basic quantative analysis of a dataset of numerical values that can be inputted with their frequency. Expand to standard deviation / variance, inter-quartile ranges, histogram and smart anomaly detection/suggestion.

Proof of concept using quadratic formula, but numerical methods for root finding of nth polynomials in development.
