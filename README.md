# WPFCalculator
WPFCalculator is a calculator designed in WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation) based on some of the features of Casio's CG50 Graphical Calculator.

Graphing calculator with adjustable bounds. Useful for intuition / understanding of behaviour of trigonometric, hyperbolic and rational functions.

Chi test as taught in A-level AQA Further Mathematics. The user inputs the grid size, then the values to receive the expected table. Calculator can then return chi test statistic.

As shown above, 2x2 tables (that have one degree of freedom) asks for if Yate's correction should be used. Yate's correction important in AQA Further Mathematics but current

Currently basic quantative analysis of a dataset of numerical values that can be inputted with their frequency. Expand to standard deviation / variance, inter-quartile ranges, histogram and smart anomaly detection/suggestion.
